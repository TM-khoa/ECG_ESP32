# About this project

This project is an experimental enhanced version of the traditional ECG Holter monitor. It uses the ESP32-C3 as the host controller to capture electrocardiogram (ECG) data from the MAX30003 sensor, which is an ultra-low power, single-channel integrated biopotential AFE with R-to-R detection. The ECG data is transmitted to a mobile app via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication. The ECG waveforms are also displayed through the Serial Port.

# Block Diagram

The block diagram of the device includes MCU and multiple peripherals, including Bluetooth Low Energy. Moreover, the diagram shows a USB type C connected to a Lithium battery charger (for battery charging). Two pushbuttons (to turn the device on/off and to start Bluetooth advertising). three LEDs (blue LED to indicate notifications, red LED to indicate power and green LED to indicate charging status)
